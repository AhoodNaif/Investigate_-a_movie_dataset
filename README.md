### Investigate_-a_movie_dataset
A project in Data Analysis Udacity Course 


# Background
In this project, I will go through the data analysis process to investigate The Movie Database (TMDb) which contains various info about movies such as their genres, budget etc.

# Software to accomplish the project?
To complete this project, I will be using Python plus the following libraries:

Pandas and NumPy 
Matplotlib (produce plots)

# Exploring Questions
I chose to investigate the following questions from the dataset:
Does people like to watch movies ,explain your answer ? 
Name the five highest movies revenue and how can you describe the relationship between budget and revenue 'are the dependent' ?
How come the runtime affect the popularity ? 

# Data Wrangling
In this part, 

Deleting unnecessary columns
Dropping duplicated rows
Tweaking illogical values
Exploratory Data Analysis

Once I had a clean dataset, I was able to move on further with investigating the dataset. To answer the questions, pandas' series and DataFrame objects were used to access data more conveniently. Once the questions were answered, they were plotted using Matplotlib for clear visuals of the results.

# Conclusions
•Popularity of watching movies is increased notacibally.
•Number of released movies increased anually.
•Highest movie revenue is Jurassic World with revenue 1513528810 in 2015.
•Budget and revenue have positive relationship.
•Movies with good budget result in better revenues.
•budget and revenue are dependent variables.
•People tend to watch movies between 150-200.
•popularity decreased as runtime increased.
